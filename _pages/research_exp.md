## Analysis of the Spillover Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy on China's Economy (Jan 2021 – Jun 2021)
**Model Construction**: A Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model is used to explore the spillover effects of quantitative and price-based monetary policies on China's macroeconomy. The data are sourced from the Wind and CSMAR databases.

**Empirical Analysis**: In EViews, an SVAR model was established, performing stationarity, cointegration, optimal lag length, and AR root tests to ensure validity, followed by variance decomposition and impulse response analysis.


## Synthesis and Analysis of Dual-Color Fluorescent Carbon Dots (Sep 2018 – Nov 2019)

**Preparation Methods**: Red fluorescent carbon dots were prepared using the hydrothermal method, while blue fluorescent carbon dots were prepared using the microwave method.

**Probes**: The fluorescent probe reacts with $$\text{Co}^{2+}$$, $$\text{Fe}^{3+}$$, $$\text{Cu}^{2+}$$, etc., resulting in different fluorescent reactions. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the non-quenching probe remains essentially unchanged upon reaction.

**Analytical Techniques**: Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to identify functional groups, ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy for optical properties, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to study emission properties, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphological characterization.
